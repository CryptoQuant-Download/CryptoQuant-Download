## ❓ What is CryptoQuant?

CryptoQuant is a professional-grade analytics platform that provides traders, investors, and institutions with real-time market data, on-chain metrics, and blockchain intelligence. It allows users to analyze exchange flows, whale movements, miner activity, and other critical blockchain events to make informed trading and investment decisions.

The platform aggregates data from multiple blockchains and exchanges, offering insights into Bitcoin, Ethereum, stablecoins, and a wide range of altcoins. With its customizable dashboard, users can monitor price movements, funding rates, and liquidity shifts alongside unique on-chain indicators like exchange inflows/outflows, miner reserves, and token supply distribution.

CryptoQuant also offers automated alerts via email, Telegram, and browser notifications, enabling traders to react instantly to market signals. Its API allows integration with trading bots, research platforms, and institutional tools. The service is used by both individual traders and hedge funds to anticipate trends, detect accumulation/distribution phases, and manage risk with data-driven strategies.

By combining advanced blockchain analytics with easy-to-use charting tools, CryptoQuant empowers users to gain a deeper understanding of market dynamics beyond standard price action.
